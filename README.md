I'm planning to make a universal script for all DEs at some point.

# Live wallpaper for Linux XFCE
A simple script that allows you to play a GIF, video or image sequence on your desktop wallpaper!
**IMPORTANT NOTE:** I'm not sure this will work on every machine. I wrote that script especially for myself. If you discover a bug or know how to improve it, create an issue

__Make sure you have these programs installed:__
- python
- ffmpeg
- imagemagick

#### Note
I highly recommend to use `performance` CPU governor or the desktop may lag.
You can change the governor by using:
```bash
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
```
You can permanently change the governor by editing file `/etc/default/cpupower`.
Replace `#governor='powersave'` with:
```
governor='performance'
```
**Make sure to remove the `#`!**

# Usage
__IMPORTANT NOTE:__ Paths must be global, example: `/home/username/Pictures/file` not `./file` <br>
`python main.py <type> <path> <frame update wait time (optional, default 0.05)>`
- GIF (Best quality)
```bash
python main.py -gif /home/username/Pictures/mygif.gif
```
- Video (Worst quality)
```bash
python main.py -video /home/username/Videos/myvideo.mp4
```
- Image sequence (slideshow)
```bash
python main.py -sequence /home/username/Pictures/wallpapers/
```
- Last cached animation
```bash
python main.py -cache
```

### How does it work?
First it takes the GIF/video and then converts it to frames.
- Video
```python
os.system("ffmpeg -i "+path+" -vf fps=30 -vf scale=1280:720 cache/frame-%d.png")
```
- GIF
```python
os.system("convert "+path+" -coalesce cache/frame.png")
```
1. The frames are being saved in folder `cahce` that is located in the same directory as the script.
(If you use `-sequence` or `-cache` nothing is being converted)
2. Next, it runs the 2nd script that is used for changing the wallpaper, with path and wait time arguments.
```python
def runFromCache():
    os.system("python " + os.path.abspath("./wallpaper.py") + " " + os.path.abspath("./cache") + " " + str(wait_time))
```
3. Then the `wallpaper.py` keeps changing wallpaper to each frame.
```python
while True:
    time.sleep(wait_time)
    for i in range(len(sequence_files)):
        setWallpaper(path+"/"+"frame-"+str(i)+".png")
        time.sleep(wait_time)
```
(See also `setWallpaper(path)` inside code.)
# Alternatives
XFCE's wallpaper updating is very slow and leads to major lag when not waiting.
Best way to make animated wallpaper is by not using any DE that renders something on desktop (like Qtile, i3). Wallpaper on these can be updated with `feh` which is way faster. Someone already made a script for that https://github.com/thomas10-10/foo-Wallpaper-Feh-Gif
